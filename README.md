This gem offers some *main* layouts that can be used/edited:
- The `_layouts/default.html`, is the skeleton of the pages, where header,footer, assets are called. It should be used in most of the other layouts,
- The `_layouts/home.html` is the main layout the will be your home, where your blog posts will be shown;
- The `_layouts/post.html` is the layout used to present the blog posts themselves, where they will be rendered.

Inside the `_includes/` directory there are the partials that are used inside the layouts.

The stylesheets of this gem can be edited both in `_sass/` and in `assets/css/main.scss`.
The main colors of the theme can be found and customized in `_sass/variables.scss`.

To edit the current JavaScript functions of the gem, the file you are looking for is in `assets/js/init.js`.

Your blog posts (`*.md` files) should be put in the `_posts` directory.

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/victorpre/materialize-jekyll. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `https://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` tracked with Git will be released.
